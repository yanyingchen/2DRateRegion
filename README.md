# 2DRateRegion

(1) The key foundamental modules are rate_region.py and alternative_rate_region.py.

The following files are specific for my Ph.D work on ICF journal. 

(2) coding_scheme.py defines various communication schemes ( a set of inequalities) that I am interested in. 

(3) compare_* files define various comparisions among these communication schemes.

(4) simulate_* files specify different simulations of running each comparision under different paramenters.
